# Fixing XFCE4 and VRAM Issues on Gentoo Linux

## Step 1: Addressing XFCE4 Session Configuration

1. **Switch to TTY**
   - Press `CTRL+ALT+F1` to open a TTY terminal.
   - Log in with your user credentials.

2. **Remove Display Manager from rc-update**
   - Switch to the root user:
     ```bash
     sudo su
     ```
   - List available services to confirm the Display Manager name:
     ```bash
     ls /etc/init.d
     ```
   - Remove the Display Manager from startup:
     ```bash
     rc-update del display-manager
     ```
   - Stop the Display Manager:
     ```bash
     rc-config stop display-manager
     ```

3. **Start XFCE4**
   - Start the XFCE4 session manually:
     ```bash
     startxfce4
     ```

## Step 2: Fixing VRAM Issue

1. **Switch to TTY**
   - Press `CTRL+ALT+F2` to switch to another TTY terminal.
   - Log in as root.

2. **Check Kernel Configuration for PS3**
   - Run the following command to check the kernel build configuration:
     ```bash
     USE="-X" emerge gentoo-kernel-ps3 -pv
     ```
   - If the output looks like this:
     ```
     [ebuild  N    ] sys-kernel/gentoo-kernel-ps3-<version> USE="-X" ...
     ```
     It indicates that the build is missing important configurations.

3. **Modify `make.conf`**
   - Open the `make.conf` file in a text editor:
     ```bash
     nano /etc/portage/make.conf
     ```
   - Add the following line at the bottom of the file:
     ```plaintext
     FEATURES="getbinpkg"
     ```
   - Save and exit the file.

4. **Rebuild Kernel with Correct Flags**
   - Re-run the kernel build command:
     ```bash
     USE="-X" emerge gentoo-kernel-ps3 -pv
     ```

## Notes

- If the output of the kernel build still shows issues after adding the `FEATURES="getbinpkg"` option, consider rebuilding the kernel from scratch.
- Refer to the Gentoo Handbook for detailed instructions on kernel configuration and troubleshooting.

## Step 2: Fixing VRAM Issue

1. **Switch to TTY**
   - Press `CTRL+ALT+F2` to switch to another TTY terminal.
   - Log in as root.

2. **Check Kernel Configuration for PS3**
   - Run the following command to check the kernel build configuration:
     ```bash
     USE="-X" emerge gentoo-kernel-ps3 -pv
     ```
   - **Evaluate Output:**
     - If the output appears in **purple**, the package is available for installation.
     - Run the following command to install it:
       ```bash
       USE="-X" emerge gentoo-kernel-ps3
       ```
     - Reboot the system:
       ```bash
       reboot
       ```

3. **If Not Purple: Build a New Package**
   - Modify the `make.conf` file to enable binary packages:
     ```bash
     nano /etc/portage/make.conf
     ```
   - Add the following line at the bottom:
     ```plaintext
     FEATURES="getbinpkg"
     ```
   - Save and exit the file.
   - Re-run the kernel build command:
     ```bash
     USE="-X" emerge gentoo-kernel-ps3 -pv
     ```

## Notes

- After installation, verify the VRAM issue is resolved.
- If further troubleshooting is needed, consider rebuilding the kernel or consulting the Gentoo Handbook.
